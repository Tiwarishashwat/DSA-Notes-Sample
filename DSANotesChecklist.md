# DSA Notes Checklist

## What to cover?
### 1. Data Structure - Stack, Queue, Graph
### 2. Algorithm - Binary Search, Rabbit-here technique, etc
### 3. Theory - Class, Objects, etc
### 4. Problems (Brute / Better / Optimal)

## A. Data Structure:
### 1. Use a diagram and try to label its special property.
### 2. Write Time Complexity for insertion, deletion, update & searching.
### 3. Applications of the Data Structure
### 4. Raw Implementation (Pseudo code) [Syntax, constructor]
### 5. Different Functions used.
### 6. How to Iterate. (Iterate / forEach / while / for loop)

## B. Algorithm:
### 1. What is the Algorithm. (3 to 4 lines max)
### 2. Write the steps of the algorithm.
### 3. In which case this algorithm will have its best case and worst case. (QuickSort)
### 4. Time & Space Complexity of the algorithm in O notation.

## C. Theory:
### 1. Try to cover in 3 to 5 lines about what the topic is about.
### 2. What are the applications, advantages and disadvantages.

## D. Problems
### 1. Name of the problem.
### 2. Explanation of the problem in 2 lines.
### 3. What is the brute force
### 4. What is the time complexity & space Complexity
### 5. Can I solve it in a better way? If yes, then write drawbacks of brute force approach and advantage of optimal one.
### 6. Is there a most optimal solution? Exactly what it is? What is the time complexity & is it intuitive.
